# Social Project

Hi 👋 Spyne.ai Engineer,

I have completed this assignment in Flask and MongoDB.
Well, At my current company, I am heavily working on multiple flask based projects. So, i thought let's build this in flask. Though, I have more experience working with Nodejs as well.

I have covered all the features, if you have some feedback or anything else is left, Please let me know. Iam open to changes or any specific implementation
